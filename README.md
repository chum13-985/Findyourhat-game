# FIND YOU HAT
In script.js you will find the code for a simple terminal game where you, the player, have to "find" your hat (^) by using WASD keyboard keys to navigate a field composed of grass (â–‘) and dangerous holes (O).

### Start the terminal game 
```
node main.js
```

Additional Features I added
1.A welcome message that gives a brief description of the game.
2.Every step the player takes, 5 random holes shift to a different location, meaning you have to be extra careful of your next moves
3.In the code on Line 214 you can change the percentage of holes on the field to make the game more or less challenging
4.After winning or losing, you can choose to play another round or quit out of the game.

# FIND YOU HAT
In this project, an interactive terminal game called "Find your hat" was built. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

### Start the terminal game 
```
node main.js
